# G-Wave: Simulating Gravitational Waves

The goal of this project is to simulate gravitational waves emitted by moving mass in 3D space instead of the typical 2D depiction of Einstein. Doing this may open doors for a kind
of propulsion system involving gravitational waves and particle accelerators (for example). Matplotlib is used to simulate points in 3D space and equations can be used to calculate
the distortion made by objects in simulated space-time.
